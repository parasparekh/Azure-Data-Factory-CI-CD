**Workshop Summary**

In this workshop we work on implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment for Azure Data Factory using Azure DevOps. 


Azure Data Factory integrates with both Github and Azure DevOps Git for source control. For this lab, we're focussing on Azure DevOps Git. Main objective of source control is to have collaboration among developers, track changes and maintain history.

2. **Main/Master Branch** - This is a long lasing branch and changes from feature branch are merged into this main branch. This is also referred as collaborative branch.
